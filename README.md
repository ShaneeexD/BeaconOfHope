# Beacon of Hope

## Overview
Beacon of Hope is a RimWorld mod that adds a buildable beacon structure that attracts new colonists through increased event chances. The beacon can operate in different modes to attract wanderers, trigger escape pods, or open broadcasts for refugees (with the risk of raids).

## Features

### Beacon Building
- Buildable under the Misc category
- Requires steel, components, and research
- Uses 500W of power while active
- Visually glows when powered on

### Broadcast Modes
- **Wanderer Mode**: Increases the chance of wanderers joining your colony (low risk)
- **Emergency Channel**: Monitors for distress signals, increasing escape pod events (medium risk)
- **Open Broadcast**: Attracts refugees but also risks raiders intercepting your signal (high risk/reward)

### Research Tiers
- **Basic Beacon**: The initial research unlocks the standard beacon
- **Advanced Beacon**: Upgrade research for lower power usage (300W) and longer range
- **Faction Signal Booster**: Final tier allows requesting colonists directly for a silver cost

### Event System
- Active beacons influence the storyteller's event selection
- Multiple beacons stack their effects (with diminishing returns)
- Event cooldowns prevent excessive colonist gain
- Risk of raids increases with aggressive beacon use

### Mod Integrations
- **Hospitality**: Increases guest frequency when beacons are active
- **Vanilla Events Expanded**: Adjusts new events with beacon modifiers
- **RimQuest**: Use beacons to discover new quests or refugee signals

## Compatibility
- Compatible with RimWorld 1.6

## Usage Tips
- Place beacons in a secure area as they can attract hostile attention
